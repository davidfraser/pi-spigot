UCT Maths Mug
=============

[j5 International](https://j5int.com/) is a sponsor of the 
[UCT Mathematics Competition](http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/mam/outreach/competition/).

Prizewinners in 2018 received a mug with the competition logo, the j5 logo,
and a printout of the source code for a web page, written in HTML and Javascript.

If this HTML code and opened in a web browser, the web browser will begin computing
the digits of PI sequentially, and write them to the screen.

This repository contains the source code that was written on the mug, and some associated code.
