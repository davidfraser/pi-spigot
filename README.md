PI Spigot
=========

This is a repository that contains various fun mathematical explorations, including of Spigot algorithms for calculating PI.
This content was originally produced by David Fraser working for j5 and later Hexagon, as part of a collaboration with the UCT Maths Competition and other associated events.
Unusually (and probably unhelpfully) the information about the different explorations are in different branches of this repository, and this is a guide that links to them.

Here are the different mathematically-oriented mugs produced by Hexagon for the competition and related events in recent years, and also the related code and content including talks.


PI Day 2020
===========

UCT held an event on PI Day in 2020. [2020 Pi Day](https://github.com/davidfraser/pi-spigot/blob/pi-day-2020/README.md) information is in the `pi-day-2020` branch.
This is a different version of the UCT Maths Mug from 2018 focused on calculating PI using a spigot algorithm, and included a talk as well as a mug (with a different layout to the 2018 mug).
See the [README](https://github.com/davidfraser/pi-spigot/blob/pi-day-2020/README.md) for more details...

PyCon ZA 2020 Talk: Bytes of Pi
-------------------------------

At PyCon ZA 2020, I did a [talk on the talk I did for Pi Day in 2020](https://2020.za.pycon.org/talks/26-bytes-of-pi/
).
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvLdHUnpzEk) and [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/pyconza/bytes-of-pi-by-david-fraser) are available.
This is in the `bytes-of-pi-pycon-za-2020` branch; see the [README](https://github.com/davidfraser/pi-spigot/blob/bytes-of-pi-pycon-za-2020/README.md) for more info

UCT Maths Mugs
==============

The UCT Mathematics Competition, established in 1977, is an annual event for high schools in the Western Cape.  It is held on the University of Cape Town campus on an evening in April.

As part of the competition, in some years prizewinners have been given a mug with the UCT Maths Competition logo, and an interesting mathematical design.

[Hexagon PPM](https://hexagonppm.com/) is a sponsor of the 
[UCT Mathematics Competition](http://www.uctmathscompetition.org.za/) (as a continuation of the sponsorship done by j5 International, which was acquired by Hexagon PPM in 2019).

2019: Fibonacci Spiral
----------------------

The [2019 mug](https://github.com/davidfraser/pi-spigot/blob/2019/README.md) is based on the *Fibonacci Spiral*.

Prizewinners in 2019 received a mug with the competition logo, the Hexagon PPM and j5 logos, and a representation of the _Fibonacci Spiral_.

The mug contains some formulae used to define and calculate the Fibonacci sequence, and a link to the 2019 version of this webpage.

The `2019` branch of this repository contains the image files used to generate the mug, and an explanation of some Fibonacci maths.

2018: Computing PI
------------------

The [2018 mug](https://github.com/davidfraser/pi-spigot/blob/2018/README.md) is based on the *digits of pi*.

Prizewinners in 2018 received a mug with the competition logo, and a version of the j5 logo, which is _also_ the source code for a web page, written in HTML and Javascript.

If this HTML code and opened in a web browser, the web browser will begin computing the digits of PI sequentially, and write them to the screen.

The `2018` branch of this repository contains the source code that was written on the mug, and some associated code and explanations.

Previous Years
==============

Previous mugs (before j5's involvement with the competition) included the phrase "Mug up your maths" with some interesting formulae and definitions of mathematical constants.
