UCT Maths Mug
=============

[j5 International](https://j5int.com/), now part of [Hexagon PPM](https://hexagonppm.com/) is a sponsor of the 
[UCT Mathematics Competition](http://www.uctmathscompetition.org.za/).

2019
====

The [2019 mug](https://github.com/j5int/uct-maths-mug/blob/2019/README.md) is based on the *Fibonacci Spiral*.

Prizewinners in 2019 received a mug with the competition logo, the Hexagon PPM and j5 logos, and a representation of the _Fibonacci Spiral_.

The mug contains some formulae used to define and calculate the Fibonacci sequence, and a link to the 2019 version of this webpage.

The `2019` branch of this repository contains the image files used to generate the mug, and an explanation of some Fibonacci maths.

2018
====

The [2018 mug](https://github.com/j5int/uct-maths-mug/blob/2018/README.md) is based on the *digits of pi*.

Prizewinners in 2018 received a mug with the competition logo, and a version of the j5 logo, which is _also_ the source code for a web page, written in HTML and Javascript.

If this HTML code and opened in a web browser, the web browser will begin computing the digits of PI sequentially, and write them to the screen.

The `2018` branch of this repository contains the source code that was written on the mug, and some associated code and explanations.
